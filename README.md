# Org Protocol Store Link Extension (OPSLE)

A simple browser extension to capture and send links to an
`org-protocol://` handler, designed as an enhanced replacement for a
traditional bookmarklet:

```js
javascript:location.href = 'javascript:location.href='org-protocol://store-link?'
  + new URLSearchParams({url:location.href, title:document.title});void(0);
```

## Features

This extension provides multiple ways to capture links from your
browser:

- Toolbar icon - captures the current page's URL and title.

- Right-click anywhere on page - captures page's URL and title.

- Right-click on any hyperlink - captures the link's target URL and its
  text.

- Right-click on selected text - captures the current page's URL with
  the selected text as the title.
