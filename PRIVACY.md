# Privacy Policy for Org Protocol Store Link Extension

Last updated on August 15, 2025

## Introduction

This privacy policy applies to the "Org Protocol Store Link" browser
extension (hereafter referred to as "the Extension"). Your privacy is
important to us, and this policy is intended to be as simple and
transparent as possible.

## Data collection and usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.**

The Extension is designed with a singular purpose: to capture
information from your current browser session and pass it to a local
application (`org-protocol`) on your own computer. The Extension's
functionality is limited to the following actions, which are performed
entirely on your machine:

- Reading the URL and title of the current web page.
- Reading the URL and text of a link you right-click on.
- Reading text that you have selected on a web page.

This information is used solely to construct an `org-protocol://` URL,
which is then opened by your browser. At no point is this data sent to
us or any third-party server. All processing occurs locally on your
device.

## Source code transparency

We believe in full transparency. The complete source code for the
Extension is publicly available for review on GitHub. You are encouraged
to inspect the code to verify that it functions as described in this
policy.

## Changes to this privacy policy

We may update this privacy policy in the future. Any changes will be
reflected in a new version of the policy, and we encourage you to review
it periodically.

## Contact us

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please open an
issue on our GitHub repository.
